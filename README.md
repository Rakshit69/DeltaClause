  ## Todo App with React Context API

 A simple Todo app built with React and the Context API. It allows users to add, update, and delete todos, and mark them as completed.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app-react-context-api.git
cd todo-app-react-context-api
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## How it Works

The app uses the Context API to manage the state of the todos. The `TodoProvider` component wraps the entire app and provides the `todos` array, as well as the functions to add, update, and delete todos, to all child components.

The `TodoForm` component allows users to add new todos. When the user enters a todo and clicks the "Add" button, the `addTodo` function is called. This function adds the new todo to the `todos` array and updates the state of the app.

The `TodoItems` component displays the list of todos. Each todo item can be marked as completed by clicking on the checkbox. When a checkbox is clicked, the `toggleComplete` function is called. This function updates the completed status of the todo in the `todos` array and updates the state of the app.

The `TodoItem` component displays a single todo item. It includes the todo text, a checkbox to mark the todo as completed, and buttons to update and delete the todo.

## Conclusion

This is a simple example of how to use the Context API to manage state in a React application. The Context API is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify the management of complex state in large applications.

## Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets that show how the Context API is used in this app:

```javascript
// TodoProvider.js
import { createContext, useState } from "react";

const TodoContext = createContext();

const TodoProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const addTodo = (todo) => {
    setTodos((prev) => [...prev, { ...todo, id: Date.now() }]);
  };

  const updateTodo
